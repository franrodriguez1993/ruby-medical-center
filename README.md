## Ruby | Medical center

A website for a medical center built using React, React-Router-Dom, and Bootstrap.

### Overview:

Our website provides a platform for patients to access information about the medical center, including team of professionals, services offered, location, and attention schedule.

### Technologies Used:

Our website was built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. We used React-Router-Dom to handle routing and navigation between pages, and Bootstrap for styling and layout.

### Setup:

To set up our project locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. After cloning the repository, run npm install to install all necessary dependencies. To start the development server, run npm start. The website will be available at http://localhost:3000.

### Project Structure:

Our project has a simple file structure, with separate folders for components, pages, and assets. The components folder contains reusable UI elements, while the pages folder contains the main pages of the website. The assets folder contains images and other media files.
